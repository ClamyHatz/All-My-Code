This is a bot I made to help a friend with their home work. It creates a GUI that has a start button and toher things. When started it waits 5 seconds (was originaly 10min but then changed to 5sec), then searchers a given range of pixles for a specific RGB color range. In this case it searches for where a green button appears and when green pixles appear in a specific area it clicks it. then repeats about 25 times then restarts to how it was before start was clciked. 25 times because that the amount it needs to for the friends homework assignment. If it doesnt find anything while serching, it waits 5 sec then searches again, until it finds the green pixles.
