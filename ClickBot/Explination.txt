This is a bot I made to help a friend with their homework. It creates a GUI that has a start button and other things. When started, it waits 5 seconds (originally 10 minutes but then changed to 5 seconds), then searches a given range of pixels for a specific RGB color range. In this case, it searches for where a green button appears, and when green pixels appear in a particular area, it clicks it. Then, it repeats about 25 times, then restarts to how it was before the start was clicked. Twenty-five times because that is the amount it needs for the friend's homework assignment. If it doesn't find anything while searching, it waits 5 sec, then searches again until it finds the green pixels.
