Ok, so this is a big one here. I made this "game" in high school Junior, so the code is crude. The main file to run is called slime.py,
and you might have a problem with images, because of course I didn't know I good way to add images, and you know... it's python. So, you 
can just browse through the code but I'll add descriptions below this area.

This game was unfinished, because I had family issues during the making of the game, and it was just a passion project. going to leave 
will not work only the right side is complete. I'd say I did about 1/3 of the game but it was going to be huge, I only worked out the 
mapping of half the maze. The completion flags aren't implemented, but I did have plans for them.

A1 - E5 description.
So, these are the different "rooms" in my maze, in my initial design there were going to be up to 9 rooms per row so it'd be A1 - E9.
Each file is its own room, there's a 2D array per room that stores each block of the room, the 0's being empty spots, 1's being walls, 
and 2's being warp blocks that would send you to the next room over. the other numbers are just for extra blocks that are for looks.

ColRow description
This is where I made the comment and row logic for each of the blocks it took up a lot of space so I decided to put it there.

Room0 - roomMakerTop description
These are the basic temples of each of the different room types that I made it to. Their names should speak for themselves.

slime description
slime is the main of the project it contains a lot of running logic and transferring from room to room + movement of everything. this one 
is jam-packed with info and logic, so if you want to see some crazy code go there.

SlimeTime description
this was the main, it contains an older worse version of the game, if you want to see it run it I guess.

vars description
this holds variables that I use through out the code, was going to be used to store player stats.
